Tutorial 1:

In tutorial 1 we learned how to design good products and solutions. We are initially taught the process of desigining a good product or solution, by first, defining the problem, designing an appropriate solution and building and testing the solution to see if the solution actually addressed the problem. The important part is not to actually build something off the bat but to conceptually figure out if such idea would solve the problem defined. Once we figure out the users, we must understand their needs that is unmet or is still being faced today, in order to figure out a good solution.

Tutorial 2:

In tutorial 2, we learned the basics of using GitHub, a version control system that allows teams to manage their source code over time. We learned how to clone and initialize a repository, depending on whether you want to copy an existing repo or create a new repo. Then we learned how to push local changes to the remote repository as well as pull new changes made by other members. Finally, we learned how to fix one of the most basic error when using Git, which is the merge conflict.

Challenge 1:

In this challenge, we put what we learned in tutorial 1 to a real life application, trying to find a user or persona in the real world that has an existing problem. Then for that persona, we analyzed and defined the problem that they have, so that we may find an appropriate solution for the specific problem at hand.
