I choose the user group undergraduate students. Students must fulfill and excel at their time conusming and egrigious class schedule while also keeping their body and mind healhy with limited resources and experience. Coming straight out of their homes with no experience in cooking, many students fall into the trap of malnutrition through starvation or fast foods. They could use services such as uber eats to get healthier food delivered to save time, however with the cost of healthy food being higher than fast food added on top of the extra fees that must be paid to use  uber eats, cost of meals could get out of hand very quickly. They could cook for themselves, but buying groceries in small portions to feed oneself, actually preparing the dish and needing to wash dishes themselves is very time consuming and tedious. 

Problem Statement:
Undergraduate students are either malnutritioned from eating too much fast food to save money and time, or lose much of the very needed time they require to focus on their school work trying to stay healthy.
