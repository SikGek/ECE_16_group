Tutorial:

Tutorial 1:
In this tutorial, we learned how to set up the Arduino ESP 32 and connect it to our computer, configuring as needed.

Tutorial 2:
In this tutorial, we learned how to hook up basic diodes and switches like the LED and a button to the Arduino and activate them, using them as inputs and outputs through the GPIO using Arduino C in the Arduino IDE using digitalWrite and digitalRead.

Tutorial 3:
In this tutorial, we learned how to use the Serial monitor, by setting it to the right baud rate, then using Serial.print and Serial.read to take inputs from or output values into the Serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.

Challenges:

Challenge 1: We blinked the LEDS's in different frequencies and timings using on and off period and input led pins.

Challenge 2:

Using the button, we created a stopwatch, that starts when you press the button and state was off, and pauses when vice versa.

Challenge 3:

Using the same button, we created a timer, that adds 1 to the timer every time the button is pressed, and counts down whenever the button hasn't been pressed for 3 seconds. If the button is pressed again at any time, 1 second is added to the timer.
